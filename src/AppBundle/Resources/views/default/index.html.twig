    <p>This is a constantly updated catalogue of objects. Objects that are implicated in the spread of capitalism and
        consumer culture around the Pacific World, from the 16<sup>th</sup> to the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
    <p>The creation of goods for household and public consumption has fascinated historians, anthropologists, and
        archaeologists for a very long time, and this catalogue is a small contribution to a very large topic. The
        catalogue itself is not intended as a finished product, but instead as a collaborative research tool,
        encouraging researchers, institutions, collectors and the public to contribute information and photographs of
        objects, whether in museums, public collections, archaeological reports, or private collections. The catalogue
        falls into two distinct categories:</p>
    <h2>The Majolicas</h2>
    <p>The majolica ceramics come from the Andean countries. First produced under the mercantilist system of the Spanish
        colonies, these tin-glazed ceramics were widely traded, and continue to be produced in various parts of the
        Americas today. We have a fair understanding of the trade in majolicas produced and consumed in North America,
        Mesoamerica, and the Caribbean. The production and consumption of majolicas in the Andean countries has been
        less studied. This catalogue is an ongoing attempt to expand our understanding of the Andean majolicas, and I
        encourage you to contact me if you have Andean majolicas you would like to see added to the catalogue.</p>
    <h2>Tin Cans and Glass Bottles</h2>
    <p>The other role of this catalogue is to collect examples of the commercial tin cans and bottles used to preserve
        and market food and beverages in Ecuador and British Columbia, from 1860 to 1914. Ecuador and British Columbia
        because these are the places I have research connections, and because they represent two different trajectories
        of imperial, and post-imperial, history in the eastern Pacific. I have restricted the catalogue to items
        produced between 1830 and 1914 because this period encompasses the massive change in packaging technology that
        happened from the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century up until the Great War and the opening of the
        Panama Canal, when global trade developments and corporate mergers began to change the playing field of the
        consumer goods trade in the eastern Pacific.</p>
    <p>Please feel free to browse through the dropdown menus above, and to be in touch via the “contact” link if you
        have questions, or items you would like to see catalogued here. If you have specific information on individual
        objects already in the catalogue, I encourage you to contribute using the comment function in each item’s
        individual entry.</p>
